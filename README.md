### Option on Python
Python seens really strong in term of text processing

###Strengths
- Many open library for text processes like NLTK, re, etc
- variables are very flexible, so little type error will happen
- Easy to learn

###Weakness
- Structure is difficult to read sometimes, with tabs, or I'm just used to brackets
- Speed is a issue with python being a interpreted lanaguege

### Learning
In this assignment, it gave me a refresher on objects, dict, input from keyboard and files. It was quite nice re-touching on basics of python. Something I need to be better on is the error checking however.
